            <h2>About TapSwap</h2>
            <p>In the world of cryptocurrency and gaming, a new phenomenon has emerged: TapSwap. This incremental game, also known as a "clicker" game, has taken the internet by storm, with millions of players worldwide. But what exactly is TapSwap, and how does it work?</p>
            <p>At its core, TapSwap is a simple game. Players tap a button to earn in-game currency, which can be used to upgrade their progress and earn more coins. The game offers daily boosters, tasks, and referral rewards to help players speed up their progress. But what sets TapSwap apart is its integration with the Telegram messaging app and its use of cryptocurrency.</p>
